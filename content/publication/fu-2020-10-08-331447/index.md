abstract: The translin/trax microRNA-degrading enzyme mediates activity-induced changes
  in translation that underlie several long-lasting forms of cellular plasticity.
  As translin and trax are expressed in dopaminergic and striatal neurons, we investigated
  whether deletion of *Tsn* blocks amphetamine sensitization, a long-lasting, translation-dependent
  form of behavioral plasticity.Although we had hypothesized that constitutive *Tsn*
  deletion would impair amphetamine sensitization, we found, instead, that it enhances
  the hyperlocomotion produced by the initial dose of amphetamine. Since these mice
  display elevated adiposity, which alters pharmacokinetics of many drugs, we measured
  brain levels of amphetamine in *Tsn* knockout mice and found that these are elevated.
  As conditional *Tsn* deletion in adulthood does not impact adiposity, we monitored
  the locomotor response to amphetamine following this manipulation. Acute and sensitized
  responses to amphetamine are not altered in these mice, indicating that the enhanced
  amphetamine response displayed by constitutive *Tsn* knockout mice is due to *Tsn* absence
  during development.
