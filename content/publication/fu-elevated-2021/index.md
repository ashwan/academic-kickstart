abstract: Despite the high prevalence of obesity, little is known about its potential
  impact on the pharmacokinetics of psychotropic drugs. In the course of investigating
  the role of the microRNA system on neuronal signaling, we found that mice lacking
  the translin/trax microRNA-degrading enzyme display an exaggerated locomotor response
  to amphetamine. As these mice display robust adiposity in the context of normal
  body weight, we checked whether this phenotype might reflect elevated brain levels
  of amphetamine. To assess this hypothesis, we compared plasma and brain amphetamine
  levels of wild type and Tsn KO mice. Furthermore, we checked the effect of diet-induced
  increases in adiposity on plasma and brain amphetamine levels in wild type mice.
  Brain amphetamine levels were higher in Tsn KO mice than in wild type littermates
  and correlated with adiposity. Analysis of the effect of diet-induced increases
  in adiposity in wild type mice on brain amphetamine levels also demonstrated that
  brain amphetamine levels correlate with adiposity. Increased adiposity displayed
  by Tsn KO mice or by wild type mice fed a high-fat diet correlates with elevated
  brain amphetamine levels. As amphetamine and its analogues are widely used to treat
  attention deficit disorder, which is associated with obesity, further studies are
  warranted to assess the impact of adiposity on amphetamine levels in these patients.
