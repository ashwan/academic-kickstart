abstract: Open and reproducible research practices increase the reusability and impact
  of scientific research. The reproducibility of research results is influenced by
  many factors, most of which can be addressed by improved education and training.
  Here we describe how workshops developed by the Reproducibility for Everyone (R4E)
  initiative can be customized to provide researchers at all career stages and across
  most disciplines with education and training in reproducible research practices.
  The R4E initiative, which is led by volunteers, has reached more than 3000 researchers
  worldwide to date, and all workshop materials, including accompanying resources,
  are available under a CC-BY 4.0 license at https://www.repro4everyone.org/.
