abstract: Mentorship is experience and/or knowledge-based guidance. Mentors support,
  sponsor and advocate for mentees. Having one or more mentors when you seek advice
  can significantly influence and improve your research endeavours, well-being and
  career development. Positive mentee-mentor relationships are vital for maintaining
  work-life balance and success in careers. Early-career researchers (ECRs), in particular,
  can benefit from mentorship to navigate challenges in academic and nonacademic life
  and careers. Yet, strategies for selecting mentors and maintaining interactions
  with them are often underdiscussed within research environments. In this Words of
  Advice, we provide recommendations for ECRs to seek and manage mentorship interactions.
  Our article draws from our experiences as ECRs and published work, to provide suggestions
  for mentees to proactively promote beneficial mentorship interactions. The recommended
  practices highlight the importance of identifying mentorship needs, planning and
  selecting multiple and diverse mentors, setting goals, and maintaining constructive,
  and mutually beneficial working relationships with mentors.
